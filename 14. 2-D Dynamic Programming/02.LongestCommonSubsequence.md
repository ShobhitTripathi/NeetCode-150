# [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)
Medium


Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
- text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Approach
```
Approach
Use top-down recursion where each state (i, j) represents the LCS of text1[i:] and text2[j:].
If characters match, include 1 + result of next indices; otherwise explore both skip options and take the maximum.
Memoize all states to avoid recomputation of overlapping subproblems.

Key Idea 
Treat LCS as a recursion with overlapping subproblems and use memoization to compute each (i, j) state only once.

```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int[][] memo;

    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();

        // memo[i][j] = LCS of text1[i:] and text2[j:]
        memo = new int[m][n];
        for (int[] it : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(it, -1);   // initialize all cells as uncomputed
        }

        return dfs(text1, text2, 0, 0);  // start DFS from the beginning of both strings
    }

    private int dfs(String text1, String text2, int i, int j) {

        // Base case: if either string is fully consumed → no more subsequence possible
        if (i == text1.length() || j == text2.length()) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Return cached value if already computed
        if (memo[i][j] != -1) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }

        // If characters match, take 1 + LCS of remaining parts
        if (text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)) {
            memo[i][j] = 1 + dfs(text1, text2, i + 1, j + 1);

        } else {
            // Otherwise, try skipping one char from either string and take max
            memo[i][j] = Math.max(
                dfs(text1, text2, i + 1, j),    // skip char in text1
                dfs(text1, text2, i, j + 1)     // skip char in text2
            );
        }

        return memo[i][j];
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Compolexity: O(N*M), N : length of string 1, M : length of string 2
- Space Complexity: O(N*M)
```
