# [919 · Meeting Rooms II]()
Medium

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.)

> (0,8),(8,10) is not conflict at 8


Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [(0,30),(5,10),(15,20)]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We need two meeting rooms
room1: (0,30)
room2: (5,10),(15,20)
```
Example2 
```
Input: intervals = [(2,7)]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only need one meeting room
```

## Approach
```
Steps

Sort Intervals:
Sort the meetings by their start times to process them in chronological order.

Use a Min-Heap:
Maintain a min-heap to track the end times of ongoing meetings.
The heap always gives the meeting that ends the earliest.

Process Each Meeting:
For each meeting:
If the earliest ending meeting in the heap has finished (i.e., its end time ≤ current meeting's start time),
reuse that room by removing it from the heap.
Add the current meeting's end time to the heap.

Result:
The size of the heap at the end represents the number of rooms required.

Why It Works
Sorting ensures meetings are processed in order.
The min-heap efficiently tracks the earliest available room for reuse.

```

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition of Interval:
 * public class Interval {
 *     public int start, end;
 *     public Interval(int start, int end) {
 *         this.start = start;
 *         this.end = end;
 *     }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public int minMeetingRooms(List<Interval> intervals) {
    // Step 1: Sort intervals by their start times
    intervals.sort((a, b) -> a.start - b.start);
    
    // Step 2: Create a min-heap to track the end times of ongoing meetings
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    
    // Step 3: Process each interval
    for (Interval interval : intervals) {
        // If the room with the earliest end time is free, reuse it
        if (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek() <= interval.start) {
            minHeap.poll(); // Remove the earliest end time from the heap
        }
        
        // Add the current meeting's end time to the heap
        minHeap.offer(interval.end);
    }
    
    // Step 4: The size of the heap is the number of meeting rooms required
    return minHeap.size();

    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis
```
Time Complexity:
- Sorting: O(NlogN).
- Heap operations: O(NlogN).
- Total: O(NlogN).
```
