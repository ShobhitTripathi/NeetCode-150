# Minimum Interval to Include Each Query

You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [left_i, right_i] represents the ith interval starting at left_i and ending at right_i (inclusive).

You are also given an integer array of query points queries. The result of query[j] is the length of the shortest interval i such that left_i <= queries[j] <= right_i. 
If no such interval exists, the result of this query is -1.

Return an array output where output[j] is the result of query[j].

Note: The length of an interval is calculated as right_i - left_i + 1.

Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,7],[6,6]], queries = [2,3,1,7,6,8]

Output: [2,2,3,5,1,-1]
Explanation:

Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest one containing 2, it's length is 2.
Query = 3: The interval [2,3] is the smallest one containing 3, it's length is 2.
Query = 1: The interval [1,3] is the smallest one containing 1, it's length is 3.
Query = 7: The interval [3,7] is the smallest one containing 7, it's length is 5.
Query = 6: The interval [6,6] is the smallest one containing 6, it's length is 1.
Query = 8: There is no interval containing 8.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
1 <= queries.length <= 1000
1 <= left_i <= right_i <= 10000
1 <= queries[j] <= 10000
```




Approach and Complexity
```
Approach 

Sort intervals and queries;
for each query,
push all valid intervals into a min-heap (sorted by interval length) and pop those that don’t cover the query.
The heap top gives the smallest interval containing that query.

Time Complexity
O((N + Q) log N) — each interval is pushed/popped at most once, and each query may cause heap operations.

Space Complexity
O(N) — for the min-heap and the result map.

```

Solution
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] minInterval(int[][] intervals, int[] queries) {

        // Step 1: Sort intervals by start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));

        // Min-heap storing {intervalLength, intervalEnd}, sorted by smallest length
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap =
                new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        // Map to store answers for sorted queries
        Map<Integer, Integer> res = new HashMap<>();

        int i = 0; // pointer for intervals

        // Step 2: Process queries in sorted order
        for (int q : Arrays.stream(queries).sorted().toArray()) {

            // Add all intervals whose start <= current query
            while (i < intervals.length && intervals[i][0] <= q) {
                int l = intervals[i][0];
                int r = intervals[i][1];
                minHeap.offer(new int[]{r - l + 1, r}); // {length, end}
                i++;
            }

            // Remove intervals that end before the query point
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek()[1] < q) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }

            // The top of the heap gives smallest interval containing q
            res.put(q, minHeap.isEmpty() ? -1 : minHeap.peek()[0]);
        }

        // Step 3: Build result in original query order
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        for (int j = 0; j < queries.length; j++) {
            result[j] = res.get(queries[j]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```
