# [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
Hard


Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
``` 

Constraints:
- m == s.length
- n == t.length
- 1 <= m, n <= 105
- s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Approach
```
- Try to increase the window untill we have all the characters of the pattern
- Once we get the pattern, we update the result if length is less than earlier
- Shrink the window while the window have all the required characters & update the result
```

## Solution
### Approach 1
```java

class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        // If `t` is empty, there can be no valid window in `s`
        if (t.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        }

        // Maps to store the frequency of characters in `t` and the current sliding window in `s`
        Map<Character, Integer> countT = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> window = new HashMap<>();

        // Populate `countT` with the frequency of each character in `t`
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            countT.put(c, countT.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // `have` tracks how many characters in `t` are satisfied in the current window
        // `need` is the total unique characters in `t` that need to be matched
        int have = 0, need = countT.size();

        // `res` stores the starting and ending indices of the smallest valid window
        // `resLen` keeps track of the length of the smallest window found
        int[] res = {-1, -1};
        int resLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Two pointers for the sliding window
        int l = 0; // Left pointer

        // Iterate over the string `s` with the right pointer
        for (int r = 0; r < s.length(); r++) {
            char c = s.charAt(r);

            // Add the current character to the window frequency map
            window.put(c, window.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

            // If the current character is in `t` and its frequency matches, increment `have`
            if (countT.containsKey(c) && window.get(c).equals(countT.get(c))) {
                have++;
            }

            // Shrink the window from the left while all characters in `t` are satisfied
            while (have == need) {
                // Update the result if the current window is smaller than the previously found window
                if ((r - l + 1) < resLen) {
                    resLen = r - l + 1; // Update the smallest window length
                    res[0] = l;         // Update the start index of the smallest window
                    res[1] = r;         // Update the end index of the smallest window
                }

                // Remove the leftmost character from the window
                char leftChar = s.charAt(l);
                window.put(leftChar, window.get(leftChar) - 1);

                // If the left character is in `t` and its frequency becomes less than required, decrement `have`
                if (countT.containsKey(leftChar) && window.get(leftChar) < countT.get(leftChar)) {
                    have--;
                }

                // Move the left pointer forward to shrink the window
                l++;
            }
        }

        // If no valid window was found, return an empty string. Otherwise, return the smallest window substring.
        return resLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(res[0], res[1] + 1);
    }
}

### Approach 2 (Optimized)
```java
class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String str, String pattern) {
        int windowStart = 0, minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE, matched = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> charFreqMap = new HashMap<>();
        String res = "";
        for (char ch : pattern.toCharArray())
            charFreqMap.put(ch, charFreqMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);

        for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < str.length(); windowEnd++) {
            char right = str.charAt(windowEnd);

            if (charFreqMap.containsKey(right)) {
                charFreqMap.put(right, charFreqMap.get(right) - 1);
                if (charFreqMap.get(right) == 0)
                    matched++;
            }

            while (matched == charFreqMap.size()) {
                if (minLen > windowEnd - windowStart + 1) {
                    minLen = windowEnd - windowStart + 1;
                    res = str.substring(windowStart, windowEnd + 1);
                }

                char left = str.charAt(windowStart);
                if (charFreqMap.containsKey(left)) {
                    if (charFreqMap.get(left) == 0)
                        matched--;
                    charFreqMap.put(left, charFreqMap.get(left) + 1);
                }
                windowStart++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
