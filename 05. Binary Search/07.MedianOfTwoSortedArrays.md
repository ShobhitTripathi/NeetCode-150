# [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)
Hard


Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 ```

Constraints:
- nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m <= 1000
- 0 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= m + n <= 2000
- -10<sup>6</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>

## Approach
```
Ensure Binary Search on the Smaller Array:

Always perform binary search on the smaller array to minimize the search space.
Partitioning:

We aim to partition both arrays into two halves, ensuring that:
The left half contains half of the total elements.
The right half contains the remaining elements.
Partition indices are chosen such that i + j = (total + 1) / 2, where i and j are the partition indices in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Binary Search:

Perform binary search on the smaller array (nums1).
For each partition, calculate Aleft, Aright, Bleft, and Bright (the elements on the left and right of the partition).
Check if the partition is valid:
Aleft <= Bright and Bleft <= Aright. If valid, calculate the median.
Median Calculation:

If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the maximum of the left elements (Aleft, Bleft).
If the total is even, the median is the average of the maximum of the left elements and the minimum of the right elements (Aright, Bright).
Edge Case Handling:

Handle cases where one of the arrays is empty.
Time Complexity:
O(log(min(n, m))), where n and m are the lengths of the arrays. Binary search is applied to the smaller array.
Space Complexity:
O(1), since we use only a constant amount of extra space.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Assign nums1 to A and nums2 to B for easier reference
        int[] A = nums1;
        int[] B = nums2;
        
        // Calculate the total number of elements across both arrays
        int total = A.length + B.length;
        
        // Half of the total length (used to split the arrays for median calculation)
        int half = (total + 1) / 2;

        // Ensure A is the smaller array. If B is smaller, swap the arrays.
        if (B.length < A.length) {
            int[] temp = A;
            A = B;
            B = temp;
        }

        // Binary search boundaries for array A
        int l = 0;
        int r = A.length;

        // Perform binary search on the smaller array (A)
        while (l <= r) {
            // Find the partition index for array A and array B
            int i = (l + r) / 2;
            int j = half - i;

            // Elements left and right of the partition in A and B
            int Aleft = i > 0 ? A[i - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;  // Left element of A or -∞ if i = 0
            int Aright = i < A.length ? A[i] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // Right element of A or +∞ if i = A.length
            int Bleft = j > 0 ? B[j - 1] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;  // Left element of B or -∞ if j = 0
            int Bright = j < B.length ? B[j] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // Right element of B or +∞ if j = B.length

            // Check if the current partition is valid
            if (Aleft <= Bright && Bleft <= Aright) {
                // If the total length is odd, return the maximum of the left elements (median)
                if (total % 2 != 0) {
                    return Math.max(Aleft, Bleft);
                }
                // If the total length is even, return the average of the middle two elements (median)
                return (Math.max(Aleft, Bleft) + Math.min(Aright, Bright)) / 2.0;
            } else if (Aleft > Bright) {
                // If the left element of A is greater than the right element of B, reduce the search range
                r = i - 1;
            } else {
                // If the left element of B is greater than the right element of A, increase the search range
                l = i + 1;
            }
        }

        // If no valid partition was found, return -1 (this should not happen with correct input)
        return -1;
    }
}
