# [695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)
Medium


You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
``` 

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Approach
```
- DFS
- count number of dfs call inside
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private static final int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int area = 0;

        for (int i = 0;i < grid.length;i++) {
            for (int j = 0;j < grid[i].length;j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    area = Math.max(area, dfs(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return area;
    }

    public int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[i].length || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        grid[i][j] = 0;
        int res = 1;
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            res += dfs(grid, i + dir[0], j + dir[1]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
