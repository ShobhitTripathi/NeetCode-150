# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
Medium


There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= numCourses <= 2000
- 0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
- prerequisites[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.

## Approach
```
Graph Representation:
 Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list. Each course points to its prerequisites.

Cycle Detection:
 Use DFS to detect cycles. If a cycle exists, itâ€™s impossible to finish all courses.
 Maintain a visiting set to track nodes in the current recursion stack.

DFS Logic:
 If a node is already in the visiting set, a cycle is detected.
 If a node has no prerequisites (empty list in the map), it's safe to proceed.

Optimization:
 Once a course is processed without finding a cycle, mark it as "no prerequisites" (empty list) to avoid reprocessing.

Result:
 Return true if all courses are processed without cycles; otherwise, return false.

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>(); // Adjacency list to represent the graph
    private Set<Integer> visiting = new HashSet<>(); // Tracks nodes currently in the recursion stack

    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // Initialize adjacency list for each course
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            map.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        // Build the graph by adding edges (dependencies)
        for (int[] pre : prerequisites) {
            map.get(pre[0]).add(pre[1]);
        }

        // Check for cycles in the graph using DFS for each course
        for (int c = 0; c < numCourses; c++) {
            if (!dfs(c)) {
                return false; // Cycle detected
            }
        }
        return true; // No cycles, all courses can be completed
    }

    private boolean dfs(int crs) {
        if (visiting.contains(crs)) { // Cycle detected
            return false;
        }
        if (map.get(crs).isEmpty()) { // No prerequisites for this course
            return true;
        }

        visiting.add(crs); // Mark the course as being visited
        for (int pre : map.get(crs)) { // Check all prerequisites for the current course
            if (!dfs(pre)) {
                return false; // Cycle detected in prerequisites
            }
        }
        visiting.remove(crs); // Remove from recursion stack
        map.put(crs, new ArrayList<>()); // Mark this course as processed
        return true; // No cycle detected
    }
}

```
