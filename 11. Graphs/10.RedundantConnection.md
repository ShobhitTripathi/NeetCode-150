# [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)
Medium


In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
 ```

Constraints:

- n == edges.length
- 3 <= n <= 1000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
- ai != bi
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

## Approach
Ref: [Union Find](https://github.com/dipjul/NeetCode-150/blob/e7002953ae531e571f4d148f591a265dda256d7d/Algorithms/1.UnionFind.md)
```
- Using UnionFind we'll check whether the nodes of the given edge are already connected without using the current edge
- if already connect which means this edge is reduntant
- else union the nodes of the current edge
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int[] parent; // Parent array for Union-Find
    int[] rank;   // Rank array for Union-Find

    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        init(n); // Initialize Union-Find structures
        
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            // If union operation returns false, a cycle is detected
            if (!union(edge[0], edge[1])) {
                res = new int[]{edge[0], edge[1]};
            }
        }
        return res; // Return the redundant connection
    }

    // Initialize Union-Find data structure
    private void init(int n) {
        parent = new int[n + 1]; // Parent array with 1-based indexing
        rank = new int[n + 1];  // Rank array
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i; // Initially, each node is its own parent
            rank[i] = 1;   // Initial rank is 1
        }
    }

    // Find operation with path compression
    private int find(int val) {
        while (val != parent[val]) {
            // Path compression: point directly to the grandparent
            parent[val] = parent[parent[val]];
            val = parent[val];
        }
        return parent[val];
    }

    // Union operation with rank optimization
    private boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int p1 = find(x); // Find root of x
        int p2 = find(y); // Find root of y

        if (p1 == p2) {
            return false; // Cycle detected
        }

        // Union by rank: attach smaller tree under the larger tree
        if (rank[p1] > rank[p2]) {
            parent[p2] = p1; // p1 becomes parent of p2
            rank[p1] += rank[p2]; // Update rank
        } else {
            parent[p1] = p2; // p2 becomes parent of p1
            rank[p2] += rank[p1]; // Update rank
        }
        return true; // Union successful
    }
}

```
