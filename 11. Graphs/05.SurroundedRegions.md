# [130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)
Medium


Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: board = [
["X","X","X","X"],
["X","O","O","X"],
["X","X","O","X"],
["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [
["X","X","X","X"],
["X","X","X","X"],
["X","X","X","X"],
["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
 ```

Constraints:

- m == board.length
- n == board[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

## Approach
```
Boundary Check:
 Identify all 'O' cells on the boundary and mark them as safe by temporarily converting them to 'T'.

Breadth-First Search (BFS):
 Use BFS to explore all 'O' cells connected to these boundary 'O' cells. Mark these cells as 'T'.

Flip Cells:
 Traverse the board:
 Flip remaining 'O' cells (surrounded regions) to 'X'.
 Convert temporary 'T' cells back to 'O'.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    // Variables to store the number of rows and columns in the board
    private int ROWS, COLS;
    // Directions for moving up, down, left, and right
    private int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        ROWS = board.length; // Get the number of rows
        COLS = board[0].length; // Get the number of columns

        // Mark all 'O's connected to the boundary as safe (convert to 'T')
        capture(board);

        // Iterate through the board and make necessary replacements
        for (int i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    // Flip all remaining 'O's to 'X' (surrounded regions)
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == 'T') {
                    // Flip temporary 'T' back to 'O'
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void capture(char[][] board) {
        // Queue for BFS
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();

        // Add all boundary 'O' cells to the queue
        for (int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
                if ((r == 0 || r == ROWS - 1 || c == 0 || c == COLS - 1) && board[r][c] == 'O') {
                    q.offer(new int[]{r, c});
                }
            }
        }

        // Perform BFS to mark all connected 'O's as 'T'
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = q.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];

            // If the cell is 'O', mark it as 'T'
            if (board[r][c] == 'O') {
                board[r][c] = 'T';

                // Explore all four directions
                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int nr = r + dir[0]; // New row
                    int nc = c + dir[1]; // New column

                    // Check if the new cell is within bounds and add to the queue
                    if (nr >= 0 && nr < ROWS && nc >= 0 && nc < COLS) {
                        q.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
