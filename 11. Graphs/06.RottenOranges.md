# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)
Medium


You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.
- 
Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 ```

Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

## Approaches
```
- Implementation of Topological Sort
- Insert all the rotten tomatoes inside the queue as sources
- have an fresh tomato count
- while sources queue not empty,
  - we pull one pos at a time and check it's neighbour if there is any fresh tomato
  - if we found fresh tomato, we make it rotten and add to our sources queue, decrement the fresh count
  - for each run of while loop,
    - we check if the sources is not empty, increment the time
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int orangesRotting(int[][] grid) {
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int fresh = 0;  // Number of fresh oranges
        int time = 0;   // Time elapsed

        // Fill the queue with initial rotten oranges and count fresh ones
        for (int r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {  // Fresh orange
                    fresh++;
                }
                if (grid[r][c] == 2) {  // Rotten orange
                    q.offer(new int[]{r, c});  // Add to the queue
                }
            }
        }

        // Directions array for moving up, down, left, and right
        int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

        // Perform BFS to rot fresh oranges
        while (fresh > 0 && !q.isEmpty()) {
            int length = q.size();  // Number of rotten oranges to process at this level

            for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                int[] curr = q.poll();
                int r = curr[0];
                int c = curr[1];

                // Check adjacent cells
                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int row = r + dir[0];
                    int col = c + dir[1];

                    // If the adjacent cell is within bounds and has a fresh orange
                    if (row >= 0 && row < grid.length &&
                        col >= 0 && col < grid[0].length &&
                        grid[row][col] == 1) {
                        
                        grid[row][col] = 2;  // Rot the fresh orange
                        q.offer(new int[]{row, col});  // Add it to the queue
                        fresh--;  // Decrement fresh orange count
                    }
                }
            }

            time++;  // Increment time after processing one level of BFS
        }

        // If no fresh oranges remain, return the time; otherwise, return -1
        return fresh == 0 ? time : -1;
    }
}

```
- Time Complexity: O(n*m)
- Space Complexity: O(n*m)
