# [417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow]()
Medium


There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix heights where heights[r][c] represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

Return a 2D list of grid coordinates result where result[i] = [ri, ci] denotes that rain water can flow from cell (ri, ci) to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]
Output: [[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
``` 

Constraints:

- m == heights.length
- n == heights[r].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= heights[r][c] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Approach
```
Setup:
 Initialize two boolean matrices (pac and atl) to track reachability from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
 Initialize queues (pacQueue and atlQueue) with the boundary cells of each ocean.

BFS Traversal:
 For each ocean, perform BFS starting from the boundary cells.
 Mark cells as reachable and continue to adjacent cells that satisfy:
 Within grid bounds.
 Height of the new cell is greater than or equal to the current cell.
 The new cell has not been visited yet.
 Result Compilation:

Iterate through all cells in the grid.
Add cells to the result list if they are reachable by both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    // Directions for moving up, down, left, and right in the grid
    private int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

    public List<List<Integer>> pacificAtlantic(int[][] heights) {
        int ROWS = heights.length, COLS = heights[0].length; // Get the number of rows and columns in the grid
        boolean[][] pac = new boolean[ROWS][COLS]; // Tracks cells reachable by the Pacific Ocean
        boolean[][] atl = new boolean[ROWS][COLS]; // Tracks cells reachable by the Atlantic Ocean

        Queue<int[]> pacQueue = new LinkedList<>(); // Queue for BFS for the Pacific Ocean
        Queue<int[]> atlQueue = new LinkedList<>(); // Queue for BFS for the Atlantic Ocean

        // Add all cells in the first and last columns to respective queues
        for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
            pacQueue.add(new int[]{0, c}); // Top row (Pacific Ocean boundary)
            atlQueue.add(new int[]{ROWS - 1, c}); // Bottom row (Atlantic Ocean boundary)
        }

        // Add all cells in the first and last rows to respective queues
        for (int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++) {
            pacQueue.add(new int[]{r, 0}); // Left column (Pacific Ocean boundary)
            atlQueue.add(new int[]{r, COLS - 1}); // Right column (Atlantic Ocean boundary)
        }

        // Perform BFS for both oceans
        bfs(pacQueue, pac, heights);
        bfs(atlQueue, atl, heights);

        // Find cells that can reach both oceans
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int r = 0; r < ROWS; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < COLS; c++) {
                if (pac[r][c] && atl[r][c]) { // If a cell is reachable by both oceans
                    res.add(Arrays.asList(r, c)); // Add it to the result list
                }
            }
        }
        return res; // Return the result list
    }

    // BFS helper function to mark reachable cells for an ocean
    private void bfs(Queue<int[]> q, boolean[][] ocean, int[][] heights) {
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = q.poll(); // Dequeue the current cell
            int r = curr[0], c = curr[1]; // Extract row and column
            ocean[r][c] = true; // Mark the current cell as reachable
            for (int[] dir : directions) { // Explore all four directions
                int nr = r + dir[0]; // New row
                int nc = c + dir[1]; // New column
                // Check if the new cell is within bounds, higher or equal in height, and not already visited
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < heights.length && nc >= 0 && nc < heights[0].length &&
                    heights[nr][nc] >= heights[r][c] && !ocean[nr][nc]) {
                    q.add(new int[]{nr, nc}); // Add the new cell to the queue
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
