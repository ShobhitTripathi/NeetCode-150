# [91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)
Medium


A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> "1"

'B' -> "2"

...

'Z' -> "26"

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:

`"AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)`

`"KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)`

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06").
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).

## Approach
```
Recursive Solution with Memoization:
 Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible ways to decode the string.
 Use a memoization map (dp) to store results for each index to avoid recomputation.

Key Observations:
 If the character at the current index is '0', it cannot form a valid encoding.
 Check one character (s[i]) and two-character pairs (s[i]s[i+1]):
 Single character decoding is always valid for non-zero characters.
 Two-character decoding is valid only if it falls within the range 10-26.

Base Case:
 When the index reaches the end of the string (i == s.length()), return 1 because the entire string has been successfully decoded.

Recursive Relation:
 Decode one character: res += dfs(s, i + 1, dp).
 Decode two characters (if valid): res += dfs(s, i + 2, dp).

Memoization:
 Store the result for each index in the dp map.
 Avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
  
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>(); // Memoization map to store results for each index.
        dp.put(s.length(), 1); // Base case: One way to decode an empty string.

        return dfs(s, 0, dp); // Start the DFS from index 0.
    }

    private int dfs(String s, int i, Map<Integer, Integer> dp) {
        // If the result for the current index is already computed, return it.
        if (dp.containsKey(i)) {
            return dp.get(i);
        }

        // If the current character is '0', it cannot form a valid encoding.
        if (s.charAt(i) == '0') {
            return 0;
        }

        // Start with decoding one character.
        int res = dfs(s, i + 1, dp);

        // If the next two characters form a valid encoding (10-26), consider them as well.
        if (i + 1 < s.length() && (s.charAt(i) == '1' || 
                                   (s.charAt(i) == '2' && s.charAt(i + 1) < '7'))) {
            res += dfs(s, i + 2, dp);
        }

        // Memoize the result for the current index.
        dp.put(i, res);

        return res;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity:
  - Approach 1 & Approach 2: O(N)
- Space Complexity:
  - Approach 1: O(N), dp array of n size
  - Approach 2: O(1), 3 variables

```
