# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
Easy

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

## Approach
```
- Problem effectively becomes fibonacci
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int one = 1, two = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int tmp = one;
            one = one + two;
            two = tmp;
        }
        return one;
    }
}


// dfs solution
class Solution {
    int[] cache; // Cache (memoization array) to store the number of ways for each step

    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        // Initialize the cache with -1 to indicate uncomputed states
        cache = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cache[i] = -1;
        }

        // Start the recursive process from the 0th step
        return dfs(n, 0);
    }

    // Recursive function to calculate the number of ways to climb to the top
    public int dfs(int n, int i) {
        // Base case: If we've climbed exactly `n` steps, it's a valid way, return 1
        if (i >= n) {
            return i == n ? 1 : 0;
        }

        // If the result for the current step is already computed, return it
        if (cache[i] != -1) {
            return cache[i];
        }

        // Recursive case: Number of ways to climb from the current step is the sum of:
        // 1. The number of ways to climb from the next step (`i + 1`)
        // 2. The number of ways to climb from two steps ahead (`i + 2`)
        return cache[i] = dfs(n, i + 1) + dfs(n, i + 2);
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
