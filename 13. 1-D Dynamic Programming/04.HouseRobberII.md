# [213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)
Medium


You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Approach
Reference: [3. House Robber](https://github.com/dipjul/NeetCode-150/blob/d95d91ca2c7e0e25f421e3959ce0c0b62d9ba5a0/13.%201-D%20Dynamic%20Programming/3.HouseRobber.md)
```

Dynamic Programming with DFS:
 Use recursion with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum amount that can be robbed.

Track two scenarios using a flag:
 flag = 0: The first house was not robbed.
 flag = 1: The first house was robbed.

Base Cases:
 If the current index i goes out of bounds, return 0.
 If the first house was robbed (flag == 1), disallow robbing the last house (i == nums.length - 1).

Recursive Relation:
 For each house i, decide whether to:
 Skip robbing the current house and proceed to the next.
 Rob the current house and skip the next, updating the flag if it's the first house.

Final Answer:
 Take the maximum of the results from the two scenarios:
 Robbing the first house.
 Skipping the first house.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    int[][] memo; // Memoization table to store the maximum amount that can be robbed for each house and flag state.

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        // If there is only one house, rob it and return its value.
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

        // Initialize the memoization table.
        memo = new int[nums.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < memo.length; i++) {
            memo[i][0] = -1; // Case where the first house was not robbed.
            memo[i][1] = -1; // Case where the first house was robbed.
        }

        // Start the DFS from two scenarios:
        // 1. Skip the first house and allow robbing the last house.
        // 2. Rob the first house, which disallows robbing the last house.
        return Math.max(dfs(nums, 0, 1), dfs(nums, 1, 0));
    }

    // Helper function using DFS with memoization.
    // `flag` indicates whether the first house was robbed (1) or not (0).
    private int dfs(int[] nums, int i, int flag) {
        // Base case: If out of bounds or if robbing the last house when the first house was robbed.
        if (i >= nums.length || (flag == 1 && i == nums.length - 1)) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the result for this state is already computed, return it.
        if (memo[i][flag] != -1) {
            return memo[i][flag];
        }

        // Two options:
        // 1. Skip the current house and move to the next house.
        // 2. Rob the current house and skip the next house, updating the `flag` if it's the first house.
        memo[i][flag] = Math.max(
            dfs(nums, i + 1, flag), 
            nums[i] + dfs(nums, i + 2, flag | (i == 0 ? 1 : 0))
        );

        // Return the result for the current state.
        return memo[i][flag];
    }
}

```
## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(2 * N) ~ O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
```
