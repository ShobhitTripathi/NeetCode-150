# [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
Medium

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

## Approach
```

Memoization:
 The memo array stores the maximum amount that can be robbed starting from a given house index.
 This prevents redundant calculations for the same subproblem.

Base Case:
 If the index i is beyond the array (i >= nums.length), there are no more houses to rob, so the return value is 0.

Recursive Case:
 For each house at index i, decide whether to:
 Skip the current house and move to the next one (dfs(nums, i + 1)).
 Rob the current house, add its value to the result, and skip the next house (nums[i] + dfs(nums, i + 2)).

Memoization Check:
 Before recalculating, check if memo[i] already has a result for index i.

Return the Maximum:
 Store and return the maximum value between the two choices.
```
## Solution
```java
// dfs
class Solution {
    private int[] memo; // Memoization array to store results of subproblems

    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize the memo array with -1 to indicate uncomputed states
        memo = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
        // Start the DFS from the 0th house
        return dfs(nums, 0);
    }

    // Depth-first search function to calculate the maximum amount that can be robbed
    private int dfs(int[] nums, int i) {
        // Base case: if the index exceeds or equals the length of the array, return 0
        if (i >= nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        // If the result for the current index is already computed, return it
        if (memo[i] != -1) {
            return memo[i];
        }
        // Recursive case: Choose between:
        // 1. Skipping the current house and moving to the next one
        // 2. Robbing the current house and skipping the next house
        memo[i] = Math.max(
            dfs(nums, i + 1),          // Skip the current house
            nums[i] + dfs(nums, i + 2) // Rob the current house and move to the house after next
        );

        // Return the computed result for the current index
        return memo[i];
    }
}
```

```java
  // optimized
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if(n == 1)
            return nums[0];
        int prev2 = nums[0];
        int prev1 = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        
        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            int temp = prev1;
            prev1 = Math.max(prev1, nums[i]+prev2);
            prev2 = temp;
        }
        return prev1;
    } 
}
```
