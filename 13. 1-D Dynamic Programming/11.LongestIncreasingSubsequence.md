# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)
Medium


Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2500
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Approach
```
Memoization Setup:
 Use a 2D memo array where memo[i][j+1] stores the LIS starting from index i, considering the previous index as j.
 The offset j+1 is used to handle the case where j = -1 (no previous element).

DFS Function:
 The function dfs(i, j, nums) computes the LIS starting at index i, with the previous element at index j (or no previous element if j = -1).
 Base Case: If i reaches the end of the array, return 0 (no more elements to process).

Two Choices:
 Skip the current element: Call dfs(i + 1, j, nums).
 Include the current element if it is greater than the element at index j (or if j = -1): Call dfs(i + 1, i, nums) and add 1 to the result.

Combine Results:
 Take the maximum of the two choices above to calculate the LIS starting from index i.

Memoization:
 Store the result of dfs(i, j, nums) in memo[i][j+1] to avoid recomputation.

Initialization:
 Start the DFS with dfs(0, -1, nums) to consider the entire array and no previous element.
```
## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    private int[][] memo;

    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        // Initialize memo table with -1, representing uncomputed values.
        memo = new int[n][n + 1];  
        for (int[] row : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);  
        }
        // Start DFS from index 0 with no previous index (-1).
        return dfs(0, -1, nums);
    }

    private int dfs(int i, int j, int[] nums) {
        // Base case: If we reach the end of the array, LIS is 0.
        if (i == nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        // If result is already computed, return it.
        if (memo[i][j + 1] != -1) {  
            return memo[i][j + 1];
        }

        // Option 1: Skip the current element.
        int LIS = dfs(i + 1, j, nums);

        // Option 2: Include the current element if it forms an increasing subsequence.
        if (j == -1 || nums[j] < nums[i]) {
            LIS = Math.max(LIS, 1 + dfs(i + 1, i, nums));
        }

        // Store the result in the memo table.
        memo[i][j + 1] = LIS;
        return LIS;
    }
}
