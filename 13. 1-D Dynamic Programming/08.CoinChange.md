# [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)
Medium


You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= coins.length <= 12
- 1 <= coins[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
- 0 <= amount <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Approach
```
Recursive Exploration:
 Start with the target amount and explore all possible ways to reduce it using the available coins.
 For each coin, reduce the amount and recursively calculate the minimum coins needed for the remaining amount.

Base Case:
 If the amount is 0, return 0 as no coins are needed.
 If the amount becomes negative, return Integer.MAX_VALUE as it represents an invalid solution.

Memoization:
 Use a Map (memo) to store the minimum number of coins required for each amount to avoid redundant calculations.
 This improves efficiency by converting the exponential time complexity of the naive DFS to pseudo-polynomial time.

Result Check:
 If the final result is still Integer.MAX_VALUE, it means the amount cannot be formed with the given coins, so return -1.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>(); // Memoization map to store the minimum number of coins for a given amount.

    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int minCoins = dfs(amount, coins); // Start the DFS with the target amount.
        return minCoins == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minCoins; // If no solution, return -1; otherwise, return the minimum coins required.
    }

    private int dfs(int amount, int[] coins) {
        // Base case: If the amount is 0, no coins are needed.
        if (amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the result for the current amount is already computed, return it.
        if (memo.containsKey(amount)) {
            return memo.get(amount);
        }

        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize the result to a large value.

        // Try each coin to see if it contributes to the solution.
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (amount - coin >= 0) { // Only proceed if the coin does not exceed the current amount.
                int result = dfs(amount - coin, coins); // Recursively calculate the minimum coins for the reduced amount.
                if (result != Integer.MAX_VALUE) { // Update the result if a valid solution exists.
                    res = Math.min(res, 1 + result);
                }
            }
        }

        memo.put(amount, res); // Store the result in the memoization map.
        return res; // Return the minimum coins required for the current amount.
    }
}

```

Bottom up approach
```Java
public class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
                if (coins[j] <= i) {
                    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complex: O(N*K), N: amount+1, K = coins.length
- Space complexity: O(N), N: amount+1
```
