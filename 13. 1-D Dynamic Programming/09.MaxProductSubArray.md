# [152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)
Medium


Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Approach
```
Initialize Variables:
 res to store the global maximum product (initialized to nums[0]).
 curMax and curMin to track the maximum and minimum product at each step (initialized to 1).

Iterate Through Array:
 For each element num:
  Calculate the temporary value temp as curMax * num.
  Update curMax to the maximum of temp, num * curMin, or num.
  Update curMin to the minimum of temp, num * curMin, or num.
  Update res to the maximum of res and curMax.

Return Result:
 res contains the maximum product of any subarray.

Key Idea:
The algorithm maintains both curMax and curMin because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one, and vice versa. This ensures we capture all possible maximum products efficiently in O(n) time.
```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    // kadane's Algorithm
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        int res = nums[0];
        int curMin = 1, curMax = 1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            // Temporary variable to store the current max * num
            int temp = curMax * num;
        
            // Update curMax to the maximum of the three options
            curMax = Math.max(Math.max(temp, num * curMin), num);
        
            // Update curMin to the minimum of the three options
            curMin = Math.min(Math.min(temp, num * curMin), num);
        
            // Update the result with the maximum product found so far
            res = Math.max(res, curMax);
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
