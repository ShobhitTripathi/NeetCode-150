# [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)
Medium


Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= task.length <= 104
- tasks[i] is upper-case English letter.
- The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

## Approach

```

## Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each task.
        int[] count = new int[26]; // Array to store the count of tasks 'A' to 'Z'.
        for (char task : tasks) {
            count[task - 'A']++; // Increment the count for the respective task.
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create a max-heap (priority queue) to handle tasks with the highest frequency first.
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Add the task frequencies to the max-heap.
        for (int cnt : count) {
            if (cnt > 0) { // Only add tasks that exist.
                maxHeap.add(cnt);
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Initialize variables to track the time and a queue for tasks waiting for the cooldown period.
        int time = 0; // Total time required to execute all tasks.
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Queue to store tasks and their cooldown time.

        // Step 4: Process tasks until both the max-heap and the cooldown queue are empty.
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty() || !q.isEmpty()) {
            time++; // Increment time for each unit of work.

            // If there are tasks available in the max-heap.
            if (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                int cnt = maxHeap.poll() - 1; // Get the most frequent task and reduce its count.
                if (cnt > 0) { 
                    // If the task has remaining executions, add it to the cooldown queue with its next available time.
                    q.add(new int[]{cnt, time + n});
                }
            }

            // If the cooldown queue has tasks ready to be executed at the current time.
            if (!q.isEmpty() && q.peek()[1] == time) {
                maxHeap.add(q.poll()[0]); // Add the task back to the max-heap.
            }
        }

        // Step 5: Return the total time taken.
        return time;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        int max = 0; // keep the max value
        int maxCount = 0; // number of tasks with the max value
        
        for(char task : tasks) {
            freq[task-'A']++;
            if(freq[task-'A'] == max) {
                maxCount++;
            } else if(freq[task-'A'] > max) {
                max = freq[task-'A'];
                maxCount = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // number of blank sequence
        int blankSeq = max - 1;
        // number of blanks in each sequence
        int blankSeqLen = n - (maxCount - 1);
        // total empty slots
        int emptySlots = blankSeq * blankSeqLen;
        // non-max tasks count
        int availableSlots = tasks.length - (maxCount * max);
        // total amount of idle tiem
        int idleTime = Math.max(0, emptySlots - availableSlots);
        
        return tasks.length + idleTime;
    }
}
