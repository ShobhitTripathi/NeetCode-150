# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
Medium


Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

## Approach
```
- Recursion
- for each node's val we check whether it's in the range (min, max)
  - if it fails we return false
  - recursively call left and right subtree
- start with (-infinity, +infinity)
- left child -> (min, node.val)
- right child -> (node.val, max)
```

## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return valid(root, Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY);
    }

    private boolean valid(TreeNode node, double left, double right) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (!(left < node.val && node.val < right)) {
            return false;
        }

        return valid(node.left, left, node.val) && valid(node.right, node.val, right);
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(H), H : height of tree, recursive calls
```
