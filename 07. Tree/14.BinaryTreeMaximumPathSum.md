# [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)
Hard


A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 ```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Approach
```
- compare max at each node
- left call, right call
- compare max with node's val+left val, node's val+right val, node's val+left val+right val
- return max of node's val, node's val+left val, node's val+right val
```
## Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        // Initialize an array to keep track of the maximum path sum found so far.
        // Use an array to allow updates within the recursive method.
        int[] res = new int[]{root.val};

        // Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate maximum path sums.
        dfs(root, res);

        // Return the maximum path sum.
        return res[0];
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode root, int[] res) {
        // Base case: If the node is null, return 0 as there is no contribution to the path sum.
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Recursively calculate the maximum path sum from the left subtree.
        // If the result is negative, consider it as 0 (ignore the subtree).
        int leftMax = Math.max(dfs(root.left, res), 0);

        // Recursively calculate the maximum path sum from the right subtree.
        // If the result is negative, consider it as 0 (ignore the subtree).
        int rightMax = Math.max(dfs(root.right, res), 0);

        // Update the global maximum path sum. This includes the current node's value
        // and the best possible paths from both the left and right subtrees.
        res[0] = Math.max(res[0], root.val + leftMax + rightMax);

        // Return the maximum path sum starting from the current node and extending
        // to one of its subtrees (left or right). This ensures the path remains
        // contiguous for the parent node's calculation.
        return root.val + Math.max(leftMax, rightMax);
    }
}

## Complexity Analysis
```
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(logn), recursive call stacks
```
